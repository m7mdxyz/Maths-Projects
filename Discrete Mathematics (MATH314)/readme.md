# 1. MATH 314: Discrete Mathematics
This folder contains several Python scripts that implement fundamental algorithms from discrete mathematics. The projects here demonstrate the ability to translate core mathematical concepts, such as number theory and algebra, into functional code.

- Binary Addition of integers: An algorithm for adding two integers in binary form.

- Binary Modular Exponentiation: An efficient method for calculating the remainder of an exponentiation operation.

- Binary Multiplication of integers: A script that performs multiplication of two binary integers.

- Constructing Base B Expansion: A program to convert a number from base 10 to any arbitrary base B.

- Euclidean Algorithm: A classic algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.
