# Maths Projects
A collection of projects and code from various mathematics courses I completed during my university studies. This repository serves as a portfolio showcasing my ability to apply theoretical concepts from different mathematical fields to practical problems using code.

Each folder represents a specific course or topic and contains the code, a dedicated README.md file explaining the problem, solution, and relevant theory.
