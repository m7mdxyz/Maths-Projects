# 2. MATH 317: Numerical Methods
This collection of Python scripts focuses on computational methods for solving mathematical problems that are difficult or impossible to solve analytically. These projects highlight skills in numerical analysis, algorithm implementation, and approximation techniques.

- Bisection: A root-finding algorithm that repeatedly bisects an interval and selects a subinterval in which a root must lie.

- Complete Horner's Algorithm: An algorithm for efficient polynomial evaluation.

- Horner: A simplified version of Horner's method for polynomial evaluation.

- Nested multiplication (Synthetic Division): An implementation of nested multiplication, also known as synthetic division, for polynomial evaluation and root-finding.

- Newton_method: An iterative root-finding algorithm that uses the tangent line to approximate the function's root.
